## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the extension, you need to configure your SonarQube connection.

### 1. Installation

Install the "Sonar Issue Finder" extension directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

### 2. Configuration

Create a file named `sonar-config.json` inside a `.vscode` folder in the root of your workspace. This file should have the following format:

```json
// .vscode/sonar-config.json
{
  "server": "http://localhost:9000",
  "token": "[User Token]",
  "projectKey": "[project-key]"
}
````

  - **`server`**: The URL of your SonarQube server.
  - **`token`**: Your personal access token for SonarQube. You can generate one in your SonarQube profile settings under `My Account > Security`.
  - **`projectKey`**: The unique key for your project in SonarQube.

## üí° Usage

The extension adds a new panel titled "**SonarQube**" to your panel.

  - **Clickable Issues:** Click on any issue in the panel to be taken directly to the line of code.
  - **Issue Prioritization:** Issues are displayed with a clear visual hierarchy (icons and prefixes) based on their severity. This allows you to quickly identify and prioritize the most critical issues to solve first.
